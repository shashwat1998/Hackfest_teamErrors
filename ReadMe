                            From a sad personal experience of a dear friend here we present you with

Human body has 4.7-5.5 litres of blood in circulation.

We know the importance of this fixed amount of blood in the body and also that a drop in it's amount can be fatal.

Thousands of people lose their life in accidents or due to diseases when they are not provided with blood for life support in the required time.

We know that such situations can be very complex hence with an attempt to tackle all such drastic events we bring to you an application.


#DREAM-

Humans are too sensitive to pain and need. Nobody wants anyone(not only their loved ones) suffer or die due to unavailability of blood or blood components.

An Easy interactive Android application to provide you with an easy and convenient availability of the required blood and blood components during all extreme situations.


#FEATURES TO ADD-

We will have an SOS button on home screen.

We will have a form spread for local people to fill so that they become a potential donor and during an emergency they will get a pop-up message so even if they do not have the installed application and if distance permits they can help the person in need, this will lead to the application download/installation for future needs.

It will sync your Contact list and Facebook, Twitter and other social media ID to send requests and also see who is in need.

Information about nearby blood donation camps.

Integration with Google maps to send your location if blood required with suggestion to shortest path to nearest hospital with and without a blood bank(registered/unregistered).

Easy Sign Up/LogIn with location and blood group details to receive/donate.


#FURTHER PLANS-

An interface for blood banks to manage the demand and supply of the blood.

An easy contact with zero difficulty in money transaction and purchase of blood or blood components from registered Blood Banks.

Promotion of application and increasing awareness for this project with involvement of NGOs.

Addition of locations of unregistered blood banks and hospitals by users.

Spread of awareness that every individual is a potential helper in this project.

Inclusion of government in the project and with their support provide with further small blood banks installed in remote areas of the society, linking them with the application and keeping them under a parent hospital for proper working.
